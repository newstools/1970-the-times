Law enforcement agencies swooped on the Guptas’ Saxonwold compound on Monday afternoon, seizing a Porsche Cayenne‚ a Lamborghini Gallardo, two Ford Rangers, three Mercedes-Benzes‚ a BMW 5 Series and a Volkswagen Polo Vivo. Oh‚ and a helicopter. These are just some of the ‘moveable assets’ the police were searching for during the raid. The raid came after the NPA was given a restraint order for R250-million against those charged in relation to the Estina dairy project in Vrede in the Free State.
